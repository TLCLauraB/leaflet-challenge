**Title:** Using JavaScript and LeafletJS to Map Earthquake Data </br>
**Homework Repo for Challenge 15** </br>
**Author:** Laura Bishop (TLCLauraB) </br>

# Introduction

Using data collected by the Public Science Lab, I created a dashboard based on their [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). For the purposes of this assignment, I used a [static set of data](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json) provided by Bootcamp.

In total, three graphs were created -- a Bar and Bubble Chart to display the type of microbial species found in the sampling and its density, and a Gauge Chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.  There was also a Metadata display on the individual profile, and a dropdown menu to change individual profiles. I used the 'Viridis' colorset.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

**Title:** Using JavaScript and LeafletJS to Map Earthquake Data </br>
**Homework Repo for Challenge 15** </br>
**Author:** Laura Bishop (TLCLauraB) </br>

# Introduction
Using data collected by the [United States Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards), I used Python, JavaScript, and LeafletJS to create an 'Earthquake Visualization' website. The HTML and CSS were provided by edX Boot Camps LLC, but I created the JSON file to run the website.

I used data collected in the last 30 days as of October 11, 2023.

Understanding the data is updated every 30 seconds, I downloaded the geoJSON data into a file as backup.

In this challenge, I have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding!) on issues facing our planet.

# Overview
I received help and support from my fellow Data Viz classmates during class time, through Slack, and via our Discord server. I regularly attended both the before and after-class office hours.

I reviewed the Monday, October 2, 2023 class recording titled "Data Visualization with Leaflet" to refresh myself on how to create tile layer to apply the USGS data.
